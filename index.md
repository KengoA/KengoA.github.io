<h2>Hi, I'm Kengo</h2>

... and this is my blog, Kengo's Blog.

I like building scalable systems by day and trying to reinvent the wheel by night. I had long been looking for a quiet place on the Internet to document my experiments and thoughts on various topics, and finally decided to start a blog in June 2024.

I live in London and work as a software engineer at Bloomberg. Previously I worked for a MLOps startup, also in London, and prior to that I was at a marketplace company in Tokyo, where I started my career in 2020.

The minimal design of this website is _heavily_ inspired by [Alex Molas's blog], whose content I also highly recommend.
