I like building scalable systems by day and trying to reinvent the wheel by night. I was looking for a quiet place on the Internet to document my thougths and experiments on software engineering for some time, and finally decided to start a blog in November 2024.

I live in London and currently work as a Software Engineer at Bloomberg [^1]. Previously I worked for a MLOps startup also in London and prior to that I was at a marketplace company in Tokyo, where I started my career in 2020.

The minimal design of this website is _heavily_ inspired by [Alex Molas's blog], whose content I also highly recommend.
